    <h1>My Movie and Genre Interests</h1>
    <div id="introduction">
      <h2>Some Background</h2>
      <p>The first movie I ever remember viewing involved people on top of a trailer attempting to fend off two <strong>bus-sized</strong> rats!
      This was nothing out of the ordinary, though. My Dad balanced my sister and I with Disney movies and thrillers. Our bedtime stories were either recapping Disney movies in song,
      Dad reading from our astronomy book, or cracking open the Creatures in the Night book that featured a detailed painting of a vampire lurking in the shadows.
      It's slender face resembled a cross between man and mouse, but the fur on the head and the black cloak clearly insinuated a bat.
      The film that always stuck with me, however, was Trilogy of Terror II, featuring He Who Kills</p>

      <h3>Favorite Movies as a Child</h3>
     <p>As stated previously, we had a fairly good balance of films even when I was a child. The ones that still standout were:
      <ol>
        <li>Trilogy of Terror II</li>
        <li>Beauty and the Beast</li>
        <li>Robin Hood Men in Tights</li>
        <li>House (1985)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>House was a comedic horror involving a new homowner battling the supernatural experiences plaguing his home.</p>

      <h2>Movie Genres</h2>
      <h3>My Favorite Genres</h3>
      <p>Growing up, I loved both the Horror genre and Animations. I actually aspired to be an artist at one point in my life. Action movies could be fun, but the usual dry humor in them weren't enough to keep my interest.
      What I enjoyed the most ended up being either disaster movies or spoofs. In 2000, my mother made the mistake of thinking Scary Movie would have been appropriate for kids.</p>
